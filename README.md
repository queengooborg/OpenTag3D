RFID is becoming more prevalent, with each company launching their own RFID system that is incompatible with the rest. OpenTag3D strives to be a standard that allows RFID tags to work across all brands.

OpenTag3D defines a standard for the following:

- **Hardware** - The specific underlying RFID technology
- **Mechanical Requirements** - Positioning of tag on the spool
- **Data Structure** - What data should be stored on the RFID tag, and how that data should be formatted
- **Web API** - How extended data should be formatted when an optional online spool lookup is requested

## View Specification

The specification is hosted on the [OpenTag3D website](https://opentag3d.info/spec). Alternatively, you may view the raw Markdown file [here](./spec.md).

## Backers

OpenTag3D is backed by various companies that are implementing OpenTag3D into their printers, filament, add-ons, etc. See the list of companies [on the About page of the website](https://opentag3d.info/about#backers).
